Questions 3 d(i)

In order to read from a comma-separated-values (csv) file with scanner, I would use the
methods .useDelimiter(), .hasNext() and .next(). The useDelimiter() method will separate
each entry once a comma is found, and will repeat the same process for every next line in
the document. More specifically below is a code fragment that I could use to read from a
test.csv file.

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("test.csv"));
scanner.userDelimiter(",");
while(scanner.hasNext())
{
     // do something with the item of scanner.next()
}


Question 4 d(ii)

While designing the application, I first thought that a key should be unique, can easily
be identified in the map, and can easily be referenced only by its name. Any other entity
of the DevLog class (a developer or a timestamp) are objects that can be repeated, which does
not class them as unique, so it disqualifies them as potential candidate keys.
