Version: 01/05/2024

This project is part of Question 2 and 3 or TMA03 as it was provided by the
Open University's module M250, 2023-2024.

Purpose of project: To simulate a developers class/society that keeps tracks of coding projects.

How to start this project: Create a DevLog object.

How to test this project: Create a TestDevLog object.

The DevLog creates a map that accepts as key an object of type Project and a list of type String.
Each object of type Project holds information about the name of a project, a list of all the developer
names that have contributed to the project, the number of total contributions to the project and the status
of the project, if the project is completed or not. The DevLog class can update or create a new Project,
remove a project, set the status of a Project to complete, extract certain projects that were updated on
a particular date, return the number of total contributions for the current day and write all the projects
with their update dates in a .csv file.
